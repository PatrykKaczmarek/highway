**Highway** combines what’s best about Bitrise and Fastlane into one tool. It is a build system built on top of Fastlane.

## Goal

* **Combine what's best of Bitrise.yml and Fastlane.** Highway prefers declarative configuration over convenience and takes advantage of a broad library of steps provided by Fastlane.
* **Reduce feedback loops.** Provide information faster and in more detail so that you don't waste time, especially when integrated with Danger.
* **Bring us closer to Continuous Delivery.** Highway allows to easily take advantage of existing tools to finally implement production CD in our projects.
* **Allow centralization of configuration.** Provide a first-party support to set default values and behaviors across projects. In the future, adding e.g. Carthage-Rome to our projects will be a matter of editing a central “default” configuration file in some repository.
